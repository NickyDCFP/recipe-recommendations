# Recipe Recommendations with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding and the k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
This notebook contains a description and analysis of how I iteratively designed a machine learning-based recipe recommendation system for a platform that a few friends and I are building for a class. Although the application is a group project, this notebook is entirely my own workâ€”I conducted all of the algorithmic research and wrote the code myself. The professor also requires that we indicate where we've used tools like ChatGPT, so there are some extra comments in here for that reason.
