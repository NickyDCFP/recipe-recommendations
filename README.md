# Recipe Recommendations with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding and the k-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
This notebook contains a description and analysis of how I iteratively designed a machine learning-based recipe recommendation system for a platform that a few friends and I are building for a class. Although the full platform is a group project, this notebook is entirely my own workâ€”I conducted all of the algorithmic research and wrote the code myself.
